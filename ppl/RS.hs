-- | "Higher Order" Rejection Sampling

-- | A generalisation of rejection sampling, where the algorithm
-- | is provided with a "kernel" which will
-- | (a) provide samples
-- | (b) decide whether or not to accept the sample

-- * TODO
-- * This would also be fairly easy to generalise to importance sampling, which just
-- * introduces a Bernoulli decision on whether or not to accept a particular sample,
-- * increasing the acceptance rate.

-- if @m@ implies determinism --- e.g. @Identity@ --- then this is actually
-- a deterministic process. The generality of @m@ may be useful for testing,
-- since testing stochastic processes is... unreliable; but in practice it
-- will usually probably be @IO@ to use an IO generator, though a seeded gen
-- would also be possible.
