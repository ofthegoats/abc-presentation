## Probabilistic Programming

Moving towards likelihood-free programming. This means new distributions are
written as models which specify how to generate samples from that distribution.
More interestingly, *we do not need to know the probability density function*.

This means we can compose distributions/random variables with usual arithmetic
functions and /not worry about what happens to the density function!/

See #6 for inference methods
